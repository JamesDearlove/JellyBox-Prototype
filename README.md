# JellyBox

This is my very WIP Jellyfin client written natively for Xbox, and therefore all UWP devices (including Windows 10/11). It is written with C#/XAML, and also uses parts of the [Jellyfin SDK for C#](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-csharp).

## Current Progress

I've ended up archiving this repo as the prototype and rewrite this app from scratch. It never progressed far while also being incredibly buggy, and had some oversights that required signficiant refactoring to resolve.

You can find the current project in the [JellyBox repo](https://github.com/JamesDearlove/JellyBox)
