# JellyBox

This is my very WIP Jellyfin client written natively for Xbox, and therefore all UWP devices (including Windows 10/11). It is written with C#/XAML, and also uses parts of the [Jellyfin SDK for C#](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-csharp).

## Current Progress

The app is a very incomplete prototype, most expected features aren't implemented and you should not try and use it just yet.
